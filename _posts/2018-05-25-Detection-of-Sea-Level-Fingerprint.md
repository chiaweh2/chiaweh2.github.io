### What is Sea Level Fingerprint?  
<br/>
Sea level fingerprint is the regional sea level changes due to **water mass redistribution in the entire Earth system**.
<br/>

If this still feel unclear, it is normal.
Let me explain a little more detail which I believe would make the above sentence make more sense.
There are total three water reservoirs in the entire Earth system - atmosphere, ocean, and continent.
The **water mass** can **redistribute** (or move freely) between reservoirs based on air-sea interaction, river runoff, precipitation, evaporation, ice discharge, etc.
<br/>

The **redistribution of water mass** cause two instantaneous responses within the Earth system.
1. _Changes of Gravity field_ due to mass redistribution.
2. _Changes of loading on the crust_ due to remove/add water mass at a certain location.
