The GRACE satellite data has been used for more than a decade to investigate the global-scale mass redistribution since April 2002.
With the Follow-on mission which had recently (5/22/2018) been launched, the continuous (maybe with some months of gaps) measurement is truly an important achievement in the field of studying the Earth geodesy, hydrological cycle, and ice mass balance.
To make use of this incredible dataset, there are three processing centers that offer all different kinds of GRACE solution.
Each processing center generates the solution based on the GRACE observed range differences observed by the unique twin satellite setting.
This also provide an opportunity for inter-comparison on the processing steps between solutions.
