Sea level fingerprint is the regional sea level changes due to **water mass redistribution in the entire Earth system**.
<br/>

If the above sentence feels vague to you, it is quite normal.
I believe your question would be like "So what is **water mass redistribution in the entire Earth system**?" and "Why it causes regional sea level changes?"

Let us focus on the first question.
There are total three water reservoirs in the entire Earth system - the atmosphere, the ocean, and the continent.
The **water mass** can **redistribute** (or move around) between reservoirs based on some processes like air-sea interaction, river runoff, precipitation, evaporation, ice discharge, etc.
<br/>

Most people or even some scientists would just assume that this water redistribution between ocean and atmosphere (or between ocean and continent) causes the total water mass over the ocean to change.
In another word, global sea level rises when add water into the ocean and falls when remove water from the ocean.
The concept is rather straight forward.
However, sea level will not change uniformly over the entire global ocean when you take away the water mass from continent (or atmosphere) and add that into the ocean.


The **redistribution of water mass** cause two instantaneous responses within the Earth system.
1. _Changes of Gravity field_ due to mass redistribution.
2. _Changes of loading on the crust_ due to remove/add water mass at a certain location.
