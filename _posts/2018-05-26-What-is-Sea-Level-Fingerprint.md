Regional sea level variations are affected by many different physical processes in the Earth system.
Sea level fingerprint is one of the processes that changes the regional sea level due to **water mass redistribution in the entire Earth system**.

While the explanation above makes a lot of sense to me, I understand it still lacks detail description of certain concept.
For instance, " what is **water mass redistribution in the entire Earth system?** " and " Why **it causes regional sea level changes?** "

Let us focus on the first question. **What is water mass redistribution in the entire Earth system?**
There are total three reservoirs which can store water molecules in the Earth system.
They are the atmosphere, the ocean, and the continent.
In each reservoir, the water molecules can be stored in the form of water vapor, liquid water, or solid ice.
These different forms of water molecules (**water mass**) can move around (**redistribute**) between reservoirs based on some physical processes like river runoff (continent to ocean), precipitation (atmosphere to ocean or continent), evaporation (continent or ocean to atmosphere), ice discharge (continent to ocean), etc.

Base on the above concept, it seems quite straight forward that if there is any water mass move from atmosphere or continent into ocean the sea level would change.
In another word, the **global** sea level rises when water mass is added into the ocean and the **global** sea level falls when remove water from the ocean.
You may notice that I put and emphasize the word "**global**" in the above sentence.
Base on the recent remote sensing observation, mass increase over the ocean is contributed by ice sheets(), land water mass(including hydrological cycle, glacier, and ice cap), and atmospheric water content.
The figure below is show how each component contribute to the "**global**" mean sea level changes.

The concept is rather straight forward.

Most people or even some scientists would just assume that this water redistribution between ocean and atmosphere (or between ocean and continent) causes the total water mass over the ocean to change.

However, sea level will not change uniformly over the entire global ocean when you take away the water mass from continent (or atmosphere) and add that into the ocean.


The **redistribution of water mass** cause two instantaneous responses within the Earth system.
1. _Changes of Gravity field_ due to mass redistribution.
2. _Changes of loading on the crust_ due to remove/add water mass at a certain location.
